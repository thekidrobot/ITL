This example shows how to use the server side php form validation script 
along with the client side JavaScript Form validation script
( http://www.javascript-coder.com/html-form/javascript-form-validation.phtml)

The client side form validation gives immediate form validation feedback. The 
server side validation makes sure that the form submissions are validated 
even if JavaScript is disabled.
